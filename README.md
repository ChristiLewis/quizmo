## Overview

* GIVEN quizes are common during an interview, quizmo is a timed event played against other developers.
* WHEN the start button is clicked by the user, the clock starts ticking as a question appears.
* WHEN there is an incorrect answer, there is a demerit of time on the clock.
* WHEN the user answers one question, another appears until all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero.
* WHEN the game ends, the user can save their initials and score.
* WHEN there is a highest score, it is stored. 
* When the user wins the high score, they know they are ready for the job.
